Measuring user experience and satisfaction long term vs. short term is something I've been thinking about. I picked up this paper to read up on recent thinking around long-term UX and how we can measure it. This paper outlines a qualitative method to assess individual user's experience throughout the lifetime of the product, a coding method to quickly analyze the results, and a crosscheck with traditional qualitative and NPS question. A few thoughts:

* The product in the example studied by the paper is a mobile phone. It's not clear to me whether purely digital products will inspire specific UX curves in similar dimension. For example, how would identification come into play?

* I'm curious to think about how this can be adapted to products such as Facebook, where users are very engaged with the product moment to moment, but then are "dissatisfied" with the product, not necessarily because of a product experience but because of factors in other dimensions, such as privacy concerns.

* NPS data are under a lot of scrutiny nowadays in the UX community, and for good reason. I'm not sure what to think about the fact that NPS is the "benchmark" used here.

* The Attractiveness curve shows statistically significant correlation to the UX satisfaction answers. This is consistent with numerous studies showing that the visual attractiveness of the product strongly correlates to perceived usability. There is a strong and consistent body of evidence for this connection at this point. 

* Different groups of products likely have different loyalty elasticity when it comes to UX dimensions along hedonic vs. utilitarian qualities. At Upwork for example, it makes sense to speculate that hedonic qualities would matter less to our users. In a photo app, the reverse may be true.

Overall, this is an interesting method and easy enough to implement that I will try to find opportunities at work to try it out.
